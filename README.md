Word-Puzzle
===========

This is a Word Search generator, but having trouble with the adding of words to the 2D array. I have a check method
to see if the word can be placed in the 2d array but for some reason it is not working. I have no idea what I am doing wrong.
If you find my error or have any suggestions on making this program any better, please email me at tjgambs@gmail.com. Thanks. Enjoy.
